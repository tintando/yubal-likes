# yubal

A fork of [guillevc/yubal](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal) by Guillermo Alfonso Varela Chouciño — the original and canonical project.

Self-hosted YouTube Music library manager. Download, organize, and then keep on top of a music library over time.

Playlist sync. Artist/year sorting. Off-site backup. Orphan review. Media server ready.

## 🔀 How this fork differs

Upstream yubal is a downloader: paste a link, get a tagged, organized library. This fork keeps that core intact and adds the layer that comes _after_ the download — owning and operating the library over time.

None of the following exists upstream:

- **Google Drive backup** — an off-site copy kept in sync, with incremental re-upload, duplicate cleanup, and manual retry
- **Likes manager** — browse liked songs, detect YouTube-side metadata changes and like-replacements, redownload
- **Library search & cleanup** — search local files, find files no playlist references, delete with cascading `.lrc`, M3U, and Drive cleanup
- **Orphan review** — post-sync cleanup with a keep-list and a review step that pairs orphans with their replacements
- **Import** — adopt an existing music folder into the managed library
- **Sync history** — a persistent record of past syncs and per-track add/remove events
- **Multi-account cookies** — pick which Google account a single `cookies.txt` acts as
- **Standalone ReplayGain scan** — an on-demand whole-library scan with cancel (upstream tags only at download time)

Upstream's [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) asks that large feature PRs not be sent its way, so these changes live here rather than being proposed upstream. For the original project — and for anything that is not on the list above — go to [guillevc/yubal](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal).

## 📖 How It Works

Downloading music is easy. _Organizing_ it is the hard part.

yubal takes a YouTube Music URL and produces a clean, tagged music library:

```
data/
├── Pink Floyd/
│   └── 1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/
│       ├── 01 - Speak to Me.opus
│       ├── 01 - Speak to Me.lrc
│       ├── 02 - Breathe.opus
│       ├── 02 - Breathe.lrc
│       └── cover.jpg
│
├── Radiohead/
│   └── 1997 - OK Computer/
│       ├── 01 - Airbag.opus
│       ├── 01 - Airbag.lrc
│       ├── 02 - Paranoid Android.opus
│       ├── 02 - Paranoid Android.lrc
│       └── cover.jpg
│
└── _Playlists/
    ├── My Favorites [n2g-XhDv].m3u
    └── My Favorites [n2g-XhDv].jpg
```

When downloading a playlist, each track goes to its album folder—the M3U file just references them:

```m3u
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:239,Pink Floyd - Breathe
../Pink Floyd/1973 - The Dark Side of the Moon/02 - Breathe.opus
#EXTINF:386,Radiohead - Paranoid Android
../Radiohead/1997 - OK Computer/02 - Paranoid Android.opus
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The published `ghcr.io/guillevc/yubal` image is upstream's and contains none of the additions listed above. To run this fork, build it from this repository — clone it and use the bundled [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml), which builds locally rather than pulling. The compose file below is upstream's quick start, kept for reference.

```yaml
# compose.yaml
services:
  yubal:
    image: ghcr.io/guillevc/yubal:latest
    container_name: yubal
    user: 1000:1000
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      YUBAL_SCHEDULER_CRON: "0 0 * * *"
      YUBAL_DOWNLOAD_UGC: false
      YUBAL_TZ: UTC
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./config:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!TIP]
> **Volume permissions:** The container runs as UID:GID `1000:1000` by default. If your host user has a different UID, either:
>
> - Change `user:` to match your UID:GID (run `id` to check), or
> - Set ownership on the volume directories: `chown 1000:1000 -R data config`

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

> **Unraid?** Use the [community Docker template](https://github.com/SerpentDrago/UnraidDockerTemplates/tree/main/yubal) by [@SerpentDrago](https://github.com/SerpentDrago) ([unraid forum thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/197157-support-yubal-self-hosted-youtube-music-downloader/)).

## 🔌 Media Server Integration

Tested with Navidrome, Jellyfin, and Gonic. Artists link correctly, even on tracks with multiple artists.

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| **Navidrome** | ✅ Works out of the box                                       |    ✅     |
| **Jellyfin**  | ⚙️ Enable "Use non-standard artists tags" in library settings |    ✅     |
| **Gonic**     | ⚙️ Set `GONIC_MULTI_VALUE_ARTIST=multi`                       |    ❌     |

✅ Supported · ⚙️ Requires configuration · ❌ Not supported
